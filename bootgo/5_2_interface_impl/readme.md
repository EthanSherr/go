INTERFACE IMPLEMENTATION
Interfaces are implemented implicitly.

A type never declares that it implements a given interface. If an interface exists and a type has the proper methods defined, then the type automatically fulfills that interface.

ASSIGNMENT
At Textio we have full-time employees and contract employees. We have been tasked with making a more general employee interface so that dealing with different employee types is simpler.

Add the missing getSalary method to the contractor type so that it fulfills the employee interface.

A contractor's salary is their hourly pay multiplied by how many hours they work per year.
