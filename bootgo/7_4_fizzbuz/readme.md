# FIZZBUZZ

Go supports the standard [modulo operator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVNaZntwYPw&ab_channel=Bootdev):

```go
7 % 3 // 1
```

Logical [AND operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND):


```go
true && false // false
true && true // true
```

Logical [OR operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_OR):


```go
true || false // true
false || false // false
```

## ASSIGNMENT
We're hiring engineers at Textio, so time to brush up on the classic "Fizzbuzz" game, a coding exercise that has been dramatically overused in coding interviews across the world.

Complete the fizzbuzz function that prints the numbers 1 to 100 inclusive each on their own line, but substitutes multiples of 3 for the text fizz and multiples of 5 for buzz. For multiples of 3 AND 5 print instead fizzbuzz.
