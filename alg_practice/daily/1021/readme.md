Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Cisco.

Given an unsigned `8-bit` integer, swap its even and odd bits. The 1st and 2nd bit should be swapped, the 3rd and 4th bit should be swapped, and so on.

For example, `10101010` should be `01010101`. `11100010` should be `11010001`.

Bonus: Can you do this in one line?
